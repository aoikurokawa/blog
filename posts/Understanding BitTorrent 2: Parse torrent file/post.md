## Introduction 
In the [last blog](https://www.nxted.co.jp/blog/blog_detail?id=40), I wrote about [Bencode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode). Bencode is the encoding method used by BitTorrent for storing and transmitting loosely structured data. It's a binary format that serializes data types like integers, strings, lists, and dictionaries (key-value pairs).
